        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The term "itihasa" is derived from two Sanskrit words - "iti" meaning "thus" or "in this way," and "ha" meaning "certainly" or "indeed." When combined, "itihaasa" means "thus indeed it was," or "certainly, this is how it happened."</p>
        <p>It all started with our passion for café culture. Our dream was to create a premium, cozy atmosphere where customers could enjoy high-quality coffee in a warm and inviting environment.</p>
        
        <h2>The Café Experience</h2>
        <p>At Itihasa Café, we believe that the ambiance of the cafe is as important as the coffee itself. That's why we have created a cozy and comfortable space where customers can relax and enjoy their coffee.</p>
        
        <p>Our commitment to quality extends beyond our coffee and atmosphere. We believe in providing exceptional service to every customer who walks through our doors. Our friendly staff is always ready to help customers choose the perfect coffee and answer any questions they may have.</p>
